# Mini Stardew Valley!
> A terminal-based, cosy farming sim **inspired by Stardew Valley!**
> Written in Java as a practice/passion project <3

## Inspiration

After getting super into in playing ConcernedApe's **Stardew Valley**, I felt compelled to develop a mini fan version for myself.

Integrated concepts:
- OOP design

## Setup

1. Clone this repo: (or upload the src classes into a java project)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gettingfunkier/mini-stardew-valley.git
   cd mini-stardew-valley/
2. Run with Java:
   ```bash
   javac -d out $(find src/main/java -name "*.java")
   java src/main/java/Game.java
   ```

## How to play

#### Actions
- Plant crops in empty plots
- Water them every day to grow
- Once ready, harvest them
- Sell them for coins

#### Caveats
- Crops are season locked
- When the season changes, all plots reset
- Each crop takes a specific number of days to grow

## Roadmap
- Adding save files (ONGOING)
- Fishing minigame (somehow)
- Fixing player/farm name to allow strings with multiple words
- Implementing exponential reward system
- Turn GUI into some sort of interactable (props [@zF4ke](https://github.com/zF4ke))
